WinFetch is a command-line system information utility written in PowerShell 6+ for Windows. WinFetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an way similar to Neofetch and Screenfetch. 

WinFetch curently supports Windows 10; Windows 7 and Windows 8 have not yet been tested. It is highly recommended to use WinFetch with PowerShell 6+; errors may appear if any other version is used.

**WinFetch can be considered to be in beta stage**; while WinFetch does work in the majority of cases, things may break occasionally. Please report all such bugs [here](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/issues/new?title=%5BBUG%5D%20WinFetch%20is%20broken!).
